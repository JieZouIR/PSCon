# PSCon: Product Search Through Conversations

## Overview

PSCon, is designed to assist product search through conversations with human-like language. It supports dual markets and two languages, collected via a coached human-human data collection protocol.  Additionally, it includes a knowledge graph to support the development of knowledge graph-based CPS models. This dataset is unique as it is the first to offer a CPS dataset with human-like language for dual markets and multiple languages.

## Privacy

## Dataset Description

The conversation information in the PSCon dataset is stored in individual conversation_xx.json files. Each file contains a list of Python arrays, and each item in the array is a Python dictionary that represents a complete conversation. With each key indicating:

- `conv_id`: A number representing the corresponding conversation ID.
- `conversation`: Detailed conversation content.
  - `msg_id`: A unique identifier for each message in the conversation.
  - `turn_id`: The turn of the conversation.
  - `role`: The role of the messenger: user/system.
  - `content`: The specific content of the message.
  - `intent`: The intent of the user to send a message.
  - `action`: The action of the system to send a message.
  - `keywords`: The keywords in user messages.
  - `clarifying_attribute`: The attributes of system clarification action that takes effect when the action of the system is `clarify`.
  - `recommended_products`: The products recommended by the system that takes effect when the action of the system is `recommend`.
  - `user_rating`: Whether the user likes the products recommended by the system that takes effect when the system recommends the product and the `turn_id` of the message is the last turn.

To be specific, here is an example instance from conversation_en.json (Croissant file is croissant-conversation-en.json):
